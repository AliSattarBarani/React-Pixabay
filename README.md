### React-Pixabay App:
A simple React app used Pixabay API to get or pull all the details about each image uploaded by any Pixabay user. You can read more about the Pixabay API [here](https://pixabay.com/service/about/api/). 

### Tools which i used:
1. React Library: You can read more about React [here](https://reactjs.org/)
2. Material UI: You discover a lot of rich set of components and other things [here](https://material-ui.com/). If you a an amazing UI for your web apps then i highly recommended you to get start with Material UI.
3. Material UI Icons: Which is really helped me a lot because all the icons which you can see in my app got it from this [link](https://material-ui.com/components/material-icons/)
